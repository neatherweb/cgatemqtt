# cgatemqtt
Python service to provide gateway between Clipsal CBus CGate server and MQTT.

This server is designed to be used with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) (hass).
It provides integration of hass with Clipsal CBus, so it follows the hass schemas for MQTT 
for [lights](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.mqtt/#json-schema) and
for [fans](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/fan.mqtt/).

For more information on using this integration in Home Assistant see https://github.com/neatherweb/hassio-addons
